Larouex HerdRider for Netduino

Herd Rider is a Netduino Project that combines a software and analogue interface to enumerate web endpoints to capture counts and meta data and display that information using displays like Nixie Tubes, Fluorescent Display Tubes or more modern Screen Displays.

The goals of the project are...

    Simple Configuration via XML on a Micro SD card.
    XSLT or Json pathing to Pluck the Values to Display.
    Touchscreen Integrated to Configure sans a Computer.
    Thermal Printing for Journaling Threshold or other Events.
    Open Hardware and Software Design.
    Anyone can build one, but we can also sell one.

All the main data, board configurations and schematics will be on the wiki @
